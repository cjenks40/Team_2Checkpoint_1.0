#Progress on eight major tasks

 #1.Create a GitHub repository and establish best practices for team collaboration.
  Our GitHub repository is up and running, despite its scarcity of files thus far. We were able to create GitHub accounts and begin to familiarize ourselves with the platform. Some of our best practices include the following:
  Communication: We will make sure that we touch base twice throughout the week, and perhaps more as the semester winds down. We will ensure that all team members are on the same page and clear about what is due when by creating mini checkpoints and progress check ins.
  Responsibilities: We will make sure that with each deliverable or checkpoint, all members are clear on their role for that week. We plan to emphasize the point of splitting up work evenly and ensuring that there is no duplication of effort.
  Code Reviews: There will be at least two sets of eyes on each part of the project before submission for a quality assurance check.
  Clarity: Be straightforward about your time constraints and expereince level and don't be afraid to ask one another for help. 
  Documentation: Ensure that all critical portions of the project are documented to increase efficiency and ensure all requirements are met.
  Backups: We will ensure that we make regular local backups of our project to avoid accidental data loss and use continuous testing to ensure that no files have been corrupted.
  
  #2. Analyze and visualize ACS data using Tableau and/or R. 
  
  
  #3. Analyze and visualize aggregated sales data using Tableau and/or R. 
  
  
  #4. Merge aggregated liquor sales data with ACS data per each geography (zipcodes, 
cities, counties). This will result in 3 data sets. Pro Tips: If using Tableau, use 3 
workbooks. When merging ACS and annual sales data, make sure to use full outer 
merge, as it is possible that not all ACS geographies have recorded liquor sales and/or 
not all sales geographies have corresponding matches among ACS geographies 
 
 
  #5. Visualize and identify patterns in liquor sales across geographies and ACS metrics 
using R and/or Tableau.  
 
 
  #6. Submit draft of progress at Checkpoint 1 and Checkpoint 2. 
  We are currently compiling a markdown document for Checkpoint 1 detailing our progress on setting up our GitHub repo, coordinating on the eight major tasks, realizing the challenges and victories of GitHub, and documenting our contributions. We will make all efforts to submit Checkpoint 1 by Sunday, Feb. 12 at 11:59pm. The GitHub branch named Team_2Checkpoint_1.0 has been created.
  


  #7. Summarize your findings in a short video presentation.  
 We have not yet begun to create the video presentation, but are organizing our documentation so that we know which key points to highlight, as well as the obstacles we faced along the way.
 
  #8. Publish a detailed, well formatted R markdown report of your analytical story to your GitHub repository. Report requirements are outlined below. 

#Challenges and victories of collaborating on GitHub
The main challenge working and collaborating on GitHub is the overall unfamiliarity with the platform. We have experience working on group projects using Google Docs, Google Slides, Zoom, and other file sharing systems, but the interface on GitHub is not yet second nature. However, we have been watching the class videos and reading the instructional pages which are helping us to learn the various functions that can be used on GitHub.
